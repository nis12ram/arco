//! Object-store-backed control-state MVP.
//!
//! # Replay model (format version 7)
//!
//! Every manifest anchors replay on an ordered set of checksummed, non-overlapping
//! immutable Arrow IPC L1 segments and carries only the transaction suffix
//! committed since that anchor. Point and prefix reads consult segment indexes
//! before fetching Arrow data. Production commits request asynchronous layout
//! maintenance at 16 reachable L0 segments and fail closed at 32; the worker
//! renders L1 shards at half the hard segment capacity without advancing the
//! logical sequence. Explicit non-production checkpoint intervals may render
//! anchors inline for deterministic restore tests. Checkpoints materialize (or
//! reuse) the same segment set so `read_checkpoint` never replays history.
//! Segments and their indexes are bound by raw-byte checksums in every
//! reference; corrupt or substituted data fails closed.
//!
//! # Writer fencing
//!
//! Publication uses the strategy's two-condition protocol: the current-pointer
//! CAS must succeed **and** the writer's fencing epoch must be **exactly** the
//! epoch recorded in the current pointer. Only [the CAS-protected
//! claim][`ControlMvpStateStore::claim_writer_authority`] advances the epoch,
//! so an arbitrary future epoch supplied from outside can never publish and
//! can never drag the pointer epoch forward without a claim. A writer whose
//! epoch has been superseded fails closed with
//! [`CatalogError::StaleWriterEpoch`]; a writer holding an unclaimed future
//! epoch fails closed with [`CatalogError::PreconditionFailed`]. Both happen
//! before any state becomes visible. Store-maintenance writers that must
//! survive epoch claims (rather than fence competitors) adopt the published
//! epoch via [`ControlMvpStateStore::at_current_writer_epoch`].
//!
//! [`u64::MAX`] is never an acceptable epoch: accepting it (or saturating an
//! out-of-range input down to it) would make the next claim's increment
//! overflow and wedge the domain permanently, so it is rejected at every
//! entry point instead.
//!
//! Rejecting it on *input* is not enough, because a cooperative writer does
//! not supply an epoch at all — it copies the published one — and so does
//! restore-candidate generation. A pointer that already carries `u64::MAX`
//! (which no claim, publication, or restore can produce, so only corruption or
//! forgery can install one) is therefore rejected while the pointer is
//! *validated*, which is the single choke point every one of those paths goes
//! through: `at_current_writer_epoch`, `begin_control_txn`, publication,
//! `claim_writer_authority`, current-state reads, and stable restore-base
//! resolution.
//!
//! ## Repair policy for an already-published terminal epoch
//!
//! Such a domain is terminal *in place*, deliberately: nothing rewrites the
//! pointer, because a repair that silently lowered the published epoch would
//! un-fence writers the pointer says are fenced. The retained history stays
//! fully readable, because checkpoint and [`StateToken`] reads resolve through
//! manifest identity and never consult the pointer. Recovery is therefore to
//! read the retained authority through a checkpoint or state token and restore
//! it into a fresh domain scope, which begins at epoch 0 with an intact claim
//! protocol.
//!
//! # Format versioning
//!
//! Format version 7 is the only supported on-disk format and is rooted beneath
//! `control/v1/` on fresh roots. There is deliberately no migration path from
//! version 6 without integrity roots, version 5 without authenticated blocks,
//! unfenced version 4, or older JSON-anchor
//! formats: unknown and old `format_version` values fail closed.
//!
//! Before active GC deletes a candidate page, it advances HEAD's checked
//! reclamation generation by exact-version CAS under retention coordination.
//! Publishers pinned before that fence lose CAS and must regenerate artifacts.
//! Candidate identities include staging generation; transactions also bind the
//! exact observed HEAD version. A GC-only fence preserves the selected manifest,
//! logical sequence, writer epoch, and physical layout.
//!
//! Restore *plans* are versioned separately from on-disk state artifacts,
//! because an in-flight restore attempt written by an older revision must
//! still be readable by the recovery path that has to supersede it. Plan
//! versions 1 through 5 are therefore decoded as legacy plans
//! that can be inspected and superseded but can never be applied. See
//! [`ControlMvpRestorePlan`].
