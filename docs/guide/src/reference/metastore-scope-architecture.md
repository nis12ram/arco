# Metastore Scope Architecture

This page defines the target scope boundary for Arco's lakehouse catalog
metastore. It is an architecture target and migration guide, not a claim that
the current repository already stores all catalog state at this scope. For
repo-local implementation status, use the [control-plane scope scorecard](./control-plane-scope.md).

## Decision

Arco models `metastore_id` as a first-class logical scope. ADR-044 assigns
principal identity to a separate tenant-owned authority; metastore ownership
covers privileges and securable objects.

The metastore is the governed catalog authority: it owns catalogs, schemas,
tables, views, volumes, grants, storage governance, credential vending policy,
lineage bindings, governance attachments, and system projections for those
objects. A workspace is an execution and access context: it runs workloads,
queries, orchestration, notebooks, pipelines, and API requests against a bound
metastore.

The first implementation may map:

```text
metastore_id = workspace_id
```

That compatibility mapping keeps the MVP simple while preventing the public
contract from assuming that a workspace and a metastore are the same thing.

The target model is:

```text
tenant
  -> identity authority
      -> principals and lifecycle
      -> groups and membership revisions
      -> external authentication bindings
  -> metastore authority
      -> governed catalog state
      -> stable object IDs
      -> grants, ownership, and compiled permissions
      -> storage governance and credential scope
      -> authoritative workspace bindings
  -> workspace authority
      -> execution state
      -> request context
      -> orchestration state
      -> explicit binding to one or more metastores
```

## Terms

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Tenant | Top-level isolation boundary for an organization or deployment customer. |
| Identity authority | Tenant-owned principals, lifecycle, groups, membership revisions, and external identity bindings. |
| Metastore | Governed catalog authority within a tenant. It owns object identity, grants, storage governance, and catalog projections. |
| Workspace | Compute, API, and orchestration context. A workspace can access a metastore only through an explicit binding. |
| Workspace binding | Authoritative relationship that permits a workspace to use a metastore or a specific metastore-owned object. |
| Managed root | Storage root governed by the metastore, optionally constrained to a workspace binding or catalog/schema scope. |
| System table | Read-only, redacted projection over published catalog state. It is not an enforcement input. |

## Why This Boundary Matters

If the metastore is physically and logically scoped only by workspace, shared
governance becomes difficult. A tenant with `notebooks`, `pipelines`, and `bi`
workspaces would either duplicate catalog state or need out-of-band sync. That
breaks the core promise that grants, object IDs, storage bindings, and lineage
are authoritative.

If the metastore is a tenant-level object with explicit workspace bindings,
multiple workspaces can safely share one governed catalog:

```text
tenant=acme
  metastore=lakehouse_prod
    catalogs=sales, finance, ml
    grants=shared
    external_locations=shared
    stable table IDs=shared

  workspace=notebooks -> bound to lakehouse_prod
  workspace=pipelines -> bound to lakehouse_prod
  workspace=bi        -> bound to lakehouse_prod
```

This gives Arco the shape of a mature lakehouse catalog while preserving
workspace isolation for execution state.

## Scope Ownership

Tenant-identity-scoped state:

- users, service principals, workloads, and principal lifecycle
- groups and membership revisions
- verified external authentication bindings

Metastore-scoped state:

- catalogs, schemas, tables, table formats, columns, constraints, and views
- volumes, functions, registered models, and model versions
- compiled authorization inputs referencing named identity-state and metastore-state tokens; principal or membership snapshots are derived compatibility data, not identity authority
- grants, ownership, inherited permissions, and compiled authorization views
- storage credentials, external locations, managed roots, and governed paths
- credential vending policy, TTL clamps, deny reasons, and audit records
- governance attachments, policy placeholders, tags, glossary terms, and classifications
- table and object lineage bindings
- catalog, access, storage, governance, lineage, and Delta system projections

Workspace-scoped state:

- orchestration runs, tasks, sensors, schedules, backfills, and dispatch outbox
- runtime request context, workload identity, and request IDs
- workspace-local caches and temporary execution state
- derived workspace-binding lookup indexes; authoritative binding records belong to the metastore
- workspace-local observability that does not define catalog authority

Table commit coordination for managed Delta tables is metastore/table scoped,
because table identity and commit success must be shared across every bound
workspace.

## Physical Layout Target

Current code uses `ScopedStorage` with paths shaped as:

```text
tenant={tenant}/workspace={workspace}/...
```

The typed tenant identity prefix is:

```text
tenant={tenant}/identity/
```

Identity storage and its event envelope are not enabled by the prefix type.
The persisted authority scope is now versioned and carries root kind, but the
`control/v1` kernel still accepts only workspace physical roots. Metastore-scoped
storage can already construct a prefix while retaining a separate request
workspace; it is not yet a supported `control/v1` root. The first ADR-043 pilot
uses `metastore_id = workspace_id` and preserves that workspace layout.

The target catalog authority should be able to use paths shaped as:

```text
tenant={tenant}/metastore={metastore}/
  manifests/
    root.manifest.json
    catalog.pointer.json
    lineage.pointer.json
    access.pointer.json
    storage.pointer.json
    governance.pointer.json
    delta.pointer.json
  locks/
  ledger/
    catalog/
    metastore/
    access/
    storage/
    governance/
    lineage/
    delta/
  snapshots/
    catalog/
    access/
    storage/
    governance/
    lineage/
    delta/
  state/
  quarantine/
  sequence/
```

Workspace execution state can remain workspace-scoped:

```text
tenant={tenant}/workspace={workspace}/
  manifests/
  ledger/orchestration/
  state/orchestration/
  locks/
```

Do not move all domains at once. The migration should introduce a scope
abstraction first, then route catalog authority through metastore-scoped storage
while preserving the existing workspace mapping for compatibility.

## Request Context

Every request that touches catalog state should carry:

```text
tenant_id
workspace_id
metastore_id
principal_id
group_snapshot_version
request_id
```

Authorization must validate both:

1. The principal has the object privilege.
2. The workspace is bound to the metastore or object being accessed.

This prevents a user with valid table privileges from using an unbound workspace
as an unintended access path.

## Binding Semantics

Workspace bindings are authoritative metastore objects. A binding can target:

- a whole metastore
- a catalog
- a schema
- a table, view, volume, function, or model
- an external location or managed root

The first tranche should support metastore-level bindings and object-level
bindings only where credential vending or path governance requires them.

Binding evaluation should deny closed when:

- the workspace has no active binding to the metastore
- the binding is deleted, disabled, stale, or outside its effective time window
- the compiled binding view is missing or stale for an enforcement route
- the request metastore does not match the object's owning metastore

## Read Path

For a request from `workspace=bi` reading `sales.curated.orders`:

1. Authenticate the tenant principal and resolve active lifecycle and group
   membership at a named identity-state cut.
2. Resolve the workspace's metastore binding.
3. Resolve `sales.curated.orders` in the bound metastore.
4. Read the metastore's published catalog snapshot or object-native head.
5. Authorize against compiled grants and ownership using stable object IDs,
   validating both identity-state and metastore-state tokens and current
   lifecycle/freshness requirements.
6. Apply storage governance and credential scope.
7. Return metadata, scan planning data, or scoped credentials.

Hot paths must use known-key reads and pointer-selected projections. Object
storage listing is reserved for repair, migration, and anti-entropy tools.

## Mutation Path

Metastore mutations append immutable events under the metastore scope, replay
into typed state, compact into redacted Parquet projections, and become visible
only after fenced pointer publication.

Workspace context is still recorded with each mutation for audit and policy
evaluation, but it is not the durability scope for shared catalog authority.
`matches_durable_root` checks only those ownership dimensions. A domain service
must separately validate principal privileges and workspace bindings before
acquiring the writer capability. Tenant identity uses a separate identity
mutation family; the generic metastore ledger cannot write identity state.

Successful visible mutations must satisfy Arco's existing consistency model:
readers see the old complete snapshot or the new complete snapshot, never a
half-published set.

## Credential Vending

Credential vending must combine three decisions:

1. Active tenant identity and principal authorization on the object or path.
2. Workspace binding to the metastore or governed storage object.
3. Provider-specific scope and TTL limits.

Both identity and metastore/storage cuts must be revalidated before minting;
a stale compiled permission or concurrent disable requires refresh or denial.
Cross-root validation does not revoke credentials already issued by a provider;
revocation and TTL behavior require separate qualification.

The minted credential scope must be no broader than the authorized object/path
and no broader than the workspace binding permits. Deny decisions must be
auditable without exposing secret material or internal policy payloads.

## System Tables

System tables should expose both metastore and workspace dimensions where useful:

```text
system.catalog.tables
system.access.grants
system.access.compiled_permissions
system.storage.workspace_bindings
system.storage.external_locations
system.governance.attachments
```

Rows must be scoped by request tenant, authorized metastore, and workspace
binding before returning data. System tables remain read-only, redacted,
watermarked, and derived. They must not become the enforcement source of truth.

## Migration Strategy

Use a compatibility-first migration:

1. Add `metastore_id` to internal request and catalog domain contracts.
2. Default `metastore_id` to `workspace_id` where callers do not provide it.
3. Introduce a storage-scope abstraction that can produce workspace-scoped and
   metastore-scoped prefixes.
4. Add tests proving the alias mapping preserves existing paths.
5. Add workspace-binding objects and compiled binding views.
6. Move new metastore object families to metastore-scoped paths first.
7. Backfill existing catalog DDL state into metastore-scoped projections behind a
   migration flag.
8. Make compatibility adapters pass explicit `metastore_id`.
9. Require workspace binding checks for enforcement routes.
10. Retire the workspace-as-metastore alias only after migration tooling and
    rollback procedures exist.

## Identity and Scope Migration

ADR-044 resolves principal ownership at the tenant level. Its required contracts
cover token freshness, global disable, tombstones and retention-qualified purge,
ownership recovery, explicit bootstrap principals, credential vending, and
legacy-principal deduplication. These remain implementation requirements.

The **Versioned AuthorityScope in StateScope and control/v1** follow-up's
representation work now carries root kind and identifiers through the persisted
authority identity, and equal textual IDs in identity, metastore, and workspace
families remain distinct throughout tokens, continuations, restore references,
and cache identity. Existing workspace records keep their explicit compatibility
meaning; no tenant or metastore ID is substituted into a workspace field.
Enabling non-workspace `control/v1` roots still requires the remaining identity
and metastore cross-root contracts.

## Open Questions

- Should one workspace bind to multiple metastores in the first public release,
  or should that be a later expansion?
- Are managed roots always metastore-scoped, or can they be workspace-local
  roots delegated by a metastore?
- Do system-table queries default to one active metastore, or can they union
  across all metastores bound to the workspace?
- What is the user-facing error model for "object exists in a metastore, but
  this workspace is not bound to it" under the existence-privacy policy?
