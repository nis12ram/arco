# ADR-043: S3 StateToken Authority

## Status

Accepted

This ADR is the canonical authority decision for `control/v1`. ADR-018 remains
the active legacy catalog path until an exact root completes the hard-cut
procedure below. Planner/runtime migration and the proposed ADR-042 lineage
model are outside the first metastore milestone.

## Context

Arco's current catalog write path makes synchronous Parquet publication the
visibility boundary. The API appends a ledger event and waits for a separately
deployed compactor to publish a complete snapshot. That design also made the
compactor's dedicated identity the sole snapshot writer and led to a public
gRPC surface for typed calls into the service.

The `ArcoStateStore` work proved a smaller authority boundary: immutable
objects plus a conditional object-store head update can publish logical state
without making a projection part of the transaction. Arco's first GA target is
AWS, S3, API Gateway, and Lambda, where a resident writer or synchronous
compactor would defeat scale-to-zero operation. The authority format and state
transition algorithm require conditional object writes and opaque version
tokens; they do not require an S3-specific artifact or transition.

## Decision

Arco adopts an Arco-owned compare-and-swap state store as the logical authority,
with S3 as the first GA-qualified adapter. A successful conditional replacement
of an authority root's `head/current.json` is the commit point. The resulting
opaque `StateToken` identifies the committed logical sequence and immutable
authority manifest. Provider selection is deployment composition and is not
part of `StateToken`, `control/v1`, or transaction identity.

This ADR fixes the following invariants.

1. The first metastore pilot uses one workspace-as-metastore compatibility
   root per `(tenant_id, workspace_id)`, with `metastore_id = workspace_id`.
   The target metastore authority is keyed by `(tenant_id, metastore_id)`;
   [ADR-044](adr-044-tenant-level-identity-authority.md) adds a separate tenant
   identity authority. Managed Delta tables each have a separate root, as do
   Flow, lineage, and projection acknowledgements. No operation claims
   atomicity across roots.
2. Canonical state lives beneath a fresh `control/v1/` prefix. Old control
   layouts are neither read nor migrated by this release.
3. Transaction envelopes, manifests, checkpoints, and the mutable head are
   small JSON documents. Sorted key/value changes and consolidated state are
   Arrow IPC segments with checksummed JSON indexes. Before Arrow decoding,
   the kernel validates the checksum-bound footer, exact schema, supported
   metadata version and feature set, record-batch count, block arithmetic,
   stored offsets, and index bounds. Parquet is projection only.
4. A commit writes immutable transaction and segment artifacts, writes an
   immutable candidate manifest, and conditionally replaces the head. The
   state-store kernel performs one CAS and returns a typed conflict to a loser;
   the production API retry layer must re-read authority, re-evaluate every
   precondition, and retry with jitter within the 1.5-second budget. Exhaustion
   is a retryable authority conflict, never a partial success. Every head
   writer reconciles transport ambiguity: normal commits accept exact pointer
   bytes or an exact transaction reference in newer visible lineage, restore
   publication re-inspects the deterministic candidate, and writer-authority
   claims adopt only exact claimed bytes. An outcome that still cannot be
   proven committed or uncommitted returns `AmbiguousAuthorityOutcome`.
5. A committed mutation returns `CommitOutcome { state_token,
   projection_intents }`. Post-commit delivery is best effort and cannot roll
   back or change the successful authority result.
6. Projection and layout-maintenance intents are versioned envelopes.
   Projection watermarks live in a separate authority root. Segment
   consolidation may advance layout generation but never logical sequence.
7. Authorization, object existence, credential vending, and managed Delta
   commit validation read authority state, not Parquet projections. A caller's
   `StateToken` pins catalog state but never grants authorization.
8. The former catalog compactor, its synchronous client/configuration, and the
   public gRPC listener are removed at the catalog cutover. Flow may retain
   deterministic folding, but that operation is a projection and is not named
   or treated as logical catalog compaction.
9. Production logical mutations publish only bounded L0/manifest artifacts.
   They durably request layout maintenance at 16 reachable L0 segments and
   return `MaintenanceBackpressure` at 32 if consolidation has not completed.
   A separate worker publishes equivalent L1 state through exact CAS without
   incrementing logical sequence. Row, byte, index, or envelope overflow fails
   before the oversized candidate is published.
10. Current restore plans persist the positive checkpoint interval used to
    decide and render their replay anchor. Inspection and application use that
    durable value, not the receiving process's current configuration. Retired
    v1/v2 plans remain supersession-only, and a non-`control/v1` authority
    reference returns `UnsupportedAuthorityFormat` with hard-cut recovery
    direction.
11. The first metastore cut is a seeded synthetic `(tenant_id, workspace_id)`
    root. Native, UC, and Iceberg catalog operations switch together. The
    winning `StateToken` is bound internally and is not exposed in those
    protocols during the pilot.
12. The pilot uses conservative active collection: unreachable candidates are
    eligible only after seven days, token and checkpoint pins are retained for
    30 days, and pre-cutover exports plus legacy authority artifacts are kept
    indefinitely. Projection p99 lag must be at most 10 seconds, with no normal
    interval above 60 seconds, throughout a seven-consecutive-day soak.

### Scope compatibility boundary

The persisted `StateScope` is versioned. Workspace roots serialize as the legacy
v1 shape (`tenant_id`, `workspace_id`, `domain`) with no version or root marker;
every non-workspace root serializes as version 2 with an explicit
`scope_version` and `root_kind`. Decoding a record without an explicit root
marker always yields a workspace root and never relabels an ID into another
family. Unknown scope versions or root kinds are rejected before I/O.

Root kind and identifiers are carried through `StateScope`, `StateToken`,
transaction and checkpoint envelopes, manifests, projection intents,
continuation tokens (v4), retained references, restore/GC comparisons, and
catalog bindings. The workspace pilot's path bytes and token semantics are
unchanged: `ControlMvpStateStore` still requires a workspace physical root, and
legacy scoped storage cannot construct tenant identity roots.

Migration is decode-only. No persisted workspace record is rewritten, so an
existing workspace domain keeps its authority bytes and history roots, and the
old workspace encoding fixtures continue to decode as workspace roots. New
non-workspace roots are not enabled by this change. Rollback is safe for
workspace data because version-2 workspace records keep the legacy top-level
`workspace_id` and earlier readers ignore unknown fields; a rolled-back binary
must not run concurrently with a version-2 writer.

Before enabling either target root in `control/v1`, the remaining
[versioned authority-scope follow-up](../plans/2026-09-06-authority-root-review-revision.md#follow-up-versioned-authorityscope-in-statescope-and-controlv1)
must implement and qualify the identity and metastore cross-root authorization
and lifecycle contracts. Old workspace records must never be decoded as identity
or metastore roots by relabeling an ID. The pilot's seeded root and
hard-cut/provider qualification requirements continue to apply.

### Layout

Each root uses the following versioned shape:

```text
control/v1/domains/{domain}/
  head/current.json
  transactions/{id}.json
  manifests/{id}.json
  segments/l0/{id}.arrow
  segments/l1/{id}.arrow
  indexes/{segment-id}.idx
  checkpoints/{id}.json
```

The head is the only mutable object and may only be written with the selected
provider's exact-version conditional precondition. Segment rows carry sorted binary key/value data,
generation, tombstone, logical sequence, and the logical ordinal needed for
ordered records. Transaction JSON contains metadata and the immutable L0
reference; mutation and outbox payloads live only in the Arrow segment.
Indexes bind the segment checksum and record key bounds, actual Arrow
record-batch offsets, Bloom data, and row counts.

The current v4 kernel validates ordered L1 shard bounds, consults checksummed
index ranges and Bloom data before Arrow fetches, and pins scan continuations
to an exact authority manifest. JSON artifacts and decoded pages are bounded.
Logical commits durably request layout maintenance at 16 reachable L0 segments
and fail closed at 32; a separately constructed worker publishes equivalent
L1 state through exact head CAS without incrementing logical sequence. Active
retention/GC is resumable across bounded inventory pages, coordinates with
checkpoint publication, and revalidates the head and retention epoch before
deletion. Very wide prefix scans continue across bounded segment and raw-read
budgets while retaining the original authority cut. The API-level 1.5-second
catalog conflict loop and stable protocol mappings are locally implemented.
The public implementation attempts a fail-open process-local projection wake
after each committed intent, while durable anti-entropy remains authoritative.
Real-S3 correctness/performance evidence, provider queue delivery, and
always-on deployed worker scheduling remain cutover requirements rather than
claims of this revision.

### Cutover and qualification

This is a hard cut, not a dual-write migration. The old ledger and synchronous
compactor remain the current catalog runtime until native catalog routes are
explicitly switched to the new root. Cutover is forbidden until real-S3
qualification demonstrates conditional-put semantics and the stated latency,
throughput, corruption, recovery, retention, and maintenance gates.
The provider adapters use a distinct single-attempt client for conditional
writes so ambiguous transport failures reach the kernel's reconciliation path,
while safe reads and legacy operations retain the upstream bounded retry policy.
Any future provider-internal conditional retry mode, plus the deployed HTTP
error-envelope behavior for the new kernel errors, must be qualified during
route cutover; repository-only mappings and tests do not establish live
behavior.

### Storage ownership

The `control/v1` kernel depends on a narrow `ScopedAuthorityStore` capability:
scope-relative reads, metadata reads, create-if-absent writes, and exact-version
replacement. It cannot list, delete, sign, or write unconditionally through
that capability. `arco-core` owns the provider-neutral `StorageBackend`
contract and deterministic `MemoryBackend`; it does not construct cloud
clients or select a provider.

`arco-storage-object-store` owns common protocol translation. Provider-specific
builders, credential discovery, capability decisions, and credentialed live
conformance entry points are owned independently by `arco-storage-s3`,
`arco-storage-gcs`, and `arco-storage-azure`. The `arco-storage` composition
crate alone maps deployment bucket references to those adapters. Passing local
or repository conformance does not promote any provider: S3, GCS, and Azure
each require independent live evidence, and S3 remains the first GA target.
Shared adapter construction always requires an explicit conditional-write
client; custom providers must configure that client for a single request so a
lost response reaches authority reconciliation. Moving the previously
published adapter out of `arco-core` is therefore a documented Rust 0.3.0
source boundary rather than an implicit 0.2.x compatibility claim.

If a single metastore root cannot sustain 25 qualified mutations per second,
or maintenance cannot remain ahead of writes, implementation stops for a new
ADR. It must not silently add DynamoDB, a resident writer, implicit sharding,
or another state-store dependency.

## Consequences

- Logical mutation success no longer depends on projection publication or a
  synchronous compactor service.
- Ordinary point, prefix, retained-token, and bounded paginated reads use
  checksummed index bounds and Bloom metadata before fetching selected Arrow
  segments. Parquet stays useful for system-table and discovery projections.
- Immutable losing-CAS artifacts and failed post-commit deliveries require
  recovery, anti-entropy, and garbage-collection workers.
- Cross-root workflows are explicit sagas with fences and receipts rather than
  undocumented transactions.
- ADR-018 describes the pre-cutover synchronous catalog path. ADR-032's
  immutable-manifest/CAS primitive remains valid, while this ADR moves the GA
  catalog authority from Parquet snapshots to `ArcoStateStore` state.
- Repository tests and emulators prove only local behavior. Every provider
  promotion requires its own live conditional-write and recovery evidence.
  AWS promotion additionally requires live S3, KMS, SQS, IAM, Access Grants,
  STS, and regional-recovery evidence.
